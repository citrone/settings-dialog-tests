# Settings Dialog Tests

This project is part of the Chuck Noris Jokes.

I started this project to play arround with setting dialogs.

## How final application will look like

This sample project is based on Bottom Navigation Tests. As a matter of fact I cloned Bottom Navigation Tests project and use it as a base fro this one.

When the user clicks on the `Settings` button in the `AppBar`, I want to display a popup dialog with an edit box and a radio button with two options. What the user enters or selects here will be transimtted to the app as settings.

All process is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/citrone/settings-dialog-tests/wiki)
